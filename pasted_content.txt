Please create a full voice-based AI assistant that automatically answers incoming phone calls via Twilio and performs a short conversation with the customer.

The goal of the call is to collect 4 key pieces of information:

Customer’s Name

Customer’s Phone Number (+ Business Name if commercial)

The service requested (+ Make, Model & Year if it’s for a vehicle)

The service location or city

The voice of the agent should be generated using ElevenLabs (natural female voice, professional and friendly tone).

Speech-to-Text should use Google Cloud Speech-to-Text.
The assistant logic should be powered by OpenAI GPT-3.5 (for smart context awareness).

After collecting all the info, the agent should say:
“Ok, please stay by your phone, the technician will call you right back.”

The call should be initiated and managed through Twilio. The agent should support 2-way voice (customer says something → AI answers with audio).

The following API credentials should be used:
