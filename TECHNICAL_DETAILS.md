# Locksmith AI Assistant - Technical Implementation Details

This document provides technical details about the implementation of the Locksmith AI Assistant for developers and system administrators.

## System Components

### 1. Twilio Voice Response (app.py)
- Handles incoming calls via webhook
- Manages conversation state
- Processes speech input
- Generates TwiML responses

### 2. OpenAI GPT Integration (gpt_conversation.py)
- Provides context-aware conversation capabilities
- Processes customer responses
- Determines next steps in conversation flow
- Includes fallback mechanisms for API failures

### 3. ElevenLabs Voice Generation (text_to_speech.py)
- Generates natural female voice responses
- Handles audio file management
- Includes fallback to Twilio TTS if needed

### 4. Utility Functions (utils.py)
- Configures logging
- Handles API errors
- Cleans up old files
- Sanitizes user input
- Validates phone numbers

### 5. Deployment Scripts
- deploy_heroku.sh: Automates Heroku deployment
- configure_twilio.sh: Sets up Twilio webhook integration
- start.sh: Handles application startup on the server

## API Integration Details

### Twilio Integration
- Uses Twilio's TwiML for call handling
- Implements Gather for speech input
- Provides fallback mechanisms for error handling
- Webhook endpoint: /answer

### OpenAI GPT-3.5 Integration
- Uses chat completions API
- Implements system and user messages for context
- Includes conversation history in requests
- Handles API errors with fallback responses

### ElevenLabs Integration
- Uses Rachel voice (voice_id: 21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM)
- Implements temporary file management
- Includes cleanup procedures for old audio files

## Database and Storage

- Call logs stored as JSON files in call_logs directory
- Audio files stored temporarily in static directory
- Automatic cleanup of old files to prevent storage issues

## Security Considerations

- API keys stored as environment variables
- Input sanitization to prevent injection attacks
- Error handling to prevent information leakage
- Logging configured to avoid sensitive data exposure

## Performance Optimization

- Asynchronous audio generation
- Caching of frequently used responses
- Automatic cleanup of temporary files
- Configurable logging levels

## Monitoring and Maintenance

- Comprehensive logging with rotation
- Health check endpoint: /health
- Automatic cleanup of old logs and audio files
- Error tracking and reporting

## Scaling Considerations

- Stateless design for horizontal scaling
- Environment variable configuration for different environments
- Separation of concerns for easier component updates
- Cloud-native design for easy deployment
